# Spam or Ham Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to classify messages as either **spam** or **ham (non-spam)** using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop an automated system that can effectively detect and filter spam messages, improving communication security and user experience.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled messages with two main columns:
- **Category**: Label indicating whether the message is 'spam' or 'ham'.
- **Message**: The actual text content of the message.

## Problem Type
This is a **binary classification** problem, where the task is to classify messages into two categories: **Spam** or **Ham**.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Business & Data Understanding
- Understanding the significance of spam detection in communication.
- Identifying key patterns in spam messages.
- Exploring the dataset structure and characteristics.

### 2. Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Handling Missing Values**: Checked and addressed any missing data.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Identified and removed duplicate records.
- **Text Cleaning**:
  - Removed stopwords
  - Converted text to lowercase
  - Tokenized messages
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Implemented **Bag of Words (BoW)** model for text vectorization.

### 3. Model Building
- **Data Splitting**: Divided dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Text Vectorization**: Used **CountVectorizer** to transform text data into numerical format.
- **Machine Learning Models Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree / Random Forest

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix

### 5. Results & Insights
- The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics.
- Additional techniques like **TF-IDF, word embeddings, and hyperparameter tuning** can be explored for further improvement.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
  ```

### Running the Project
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the text data.
3. Train the machine learning models.
4. Evaluate the model performance.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing **Deep Learning models** (LSTM, Transformers) for improved accuracy.
- Using **TF-IDF vectorization** instead of BoW.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how NLP techniques and machine learning models can effectively classify spam messages. By implementing advanced feature engineering and tuning the models, the accuracy of spam detection can be further improved.
